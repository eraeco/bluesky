# Introduction

Twitter [Bluesky](https://blueskyweb.org/) is [@jack](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106)'s ask to solve:

1. Is it safe to trust governments or companies to label misinformation?
2. Why can't users install their own newsfeed or recommendation algorithms?
3. How can healthy content not lose out to reactionary or emotional posts?

It was an honor to have [Mark](https://twitter.com/marknadal)'s work included in the official [ecosystem](https://blueskycommunity.net/) [document](https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1352302818418446337). ERA bluesky **is not** Twitter's official system, but a Work-in-Progress of one of the [proposals](https://gitlab.com/arnoldjun/bluesky/-/blob/master/design/proposals/Mark-Nadal-Bluesky-Proposal.md) considered by [the team](https://blueskyweb.org/). It was allowed to be published publicly and is a good starting point for context to the project:
